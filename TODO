| CPU cache - both instruction and data.
| (Discrete cachelines, and just one of each, or use a monolithic cache block?  The latter will be resource-hungry.)
| DONE:  Just a single 4-word block for each direction, both read and write:
Extend: separate data read and instruction cache?

| DONE Writeback cache - to allow (a) the CPU to continue working while a write is in progress, and (b) to gang sequential
| writes into a single burst write.
| (Need to store the UDS/LDS bits along with the data.)

Sprite controller
|DONE Just one sprite, can be 2 planes at 32 pixels wide, or 4 planes at 16 pixels wide.
Need a colourtable of sorts.
| Alternatively, make the sprite 1-bit or even 2-bit truecolour?  (Implemented 1-bit ARGB for now
If we make the sprite 16 pixels wide, and devote four bits to each pixel (ARGB, where a signals transparency) then each sprite
will require a single 4-word burst per scanline.  (Then again, if we're going to devote 4 bits per pixel to the sprite, we might as well
used indexed colour and have 15-colour sprites.)

A 1-bit truecolour pointer might look like this:
"CF00000000000000",
"8CFFF00000000000",
"08CCFFF000000000",
"08CCCCFFFF000000",
"088CCCCCCFFF0000",
"008CCCCCCCC80000",
"0088CCCCCC800000",
"0008CCCCCF000000",
"0008CCCCCCF00000",
"00088CC8CCCF0000",
"00008C808CCCF000",
"0000880008CCCF00",
"00000000008CCCF0",
"000000000008CCC8",
"0000000000008C80",
"0000000000000800"};

| DONE Need to enhance the VGA controller with a "Request imminent" signal so the SDRAM controller can allow slot2 access to "nextbank".

| Need a DMA controller to handle sprite, audio, etc.  Will use the same slots as the VGA controller, but operate during the blanking period.
| Should cache data, possibly using a blockram if there end up being enough channels.  In other respects it'll end up looking very much like
| the VGA cache.  So perhaps it should be blockram based and subsume the VGA cache?

| DONE Implemented a single DMA channel for the single sprite - not yet blockram based.

Each DMA channel needs an address input and a storage register for the address.  These will be incremented each access.

A single M4K has enough space for 64 cachelines, maybe devote 4 to VGA, 1 to each sprite, 1 to each audio channel...
16 bit audio would manage 4 samples per burst, meaning a single burst each scanline would allow 120KHz sampling rate, which is way more than
we need.  Even if the video frequency dropped to 15Khz (which would halve the bandwidth usage anyway), a single burst per scanline would still
provide 60KHz.  Will definitely need two lines per channel, though.  So 4 lines minimum for audio.



(Maybe make an Amiga-style copper for the VGA controller?


Multiple screenmodes.
 -> 8bit
 -> lowres
 -> scandoubled?
 -> PAL?
 -> VBlank interrupt?

| DONE Interrupt controller.  Need to handle corner-cases better than currently, where a high-priority int occurs during the acknowledge cycle.

SD card interface.  Looks reasonably simple - just have to take care of multiple clock rates.
(DMA)?

PS/2 controller
Borrow from Chameleon project - do just the hardware transport in FPGA, handle the rest in interrupt code on the TG68.

UART - will make debugging much easier.  Need to allow upload of program code over RS232.  XMODEM?  SHould at least have ready-made software support.
(How to build a suitable binary?  Objdump?)

Hardware registers for framebuffer address
| DONE - address
To do: odd and even modulos,
Display size and timings
Sprite pointer, xpos, ypos and height.  Palette?  15 16-bit words?  Or an M4K?

Sound?
Delta-Sigma controller?  R2R ladder output, maybe 2 or 3 bits, with delta-sigma or even PWM to cover the lower bits?
