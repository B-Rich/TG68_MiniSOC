CPU cache - both instruction and data.
(Discrete cachelines, and just one of each, or use a monolithic cache block?  The latter will be resource-hungry.)

Writeback cache - to allow (a) the CPU to continue working while a write is in progress, and (b) to gang sequential
writes into a single burst write.
(Need to store the UDS/LDS bits along with the data.)

Sprite controller

Multiple screenmodes.
 -> 8bit
 -> lowres
 -> scandoubled?
 -> PAL?
 -> VBlank interrupt?

Need to handle interrupts in general.

Sprite controller.  Just one sprite, can be 2 planes at 32 pixels wide, or 4 planes at 16 pixels wide.
Need a colourtable of sorts.

SD interface
(DMA)?

PS/2 controller 

Hardware registers for framebuffer address

Sound?
